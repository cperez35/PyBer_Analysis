# Pyber Analysis 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose:

V. Isualize has given a new assignment. Using Python and Pandas, I created a:   

-   summary DataFrame of the        ride-sharing data by city type. 

Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a :
-   multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

Using two new functions, pivot() andresample(), I created    a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type.

REWIND
 ### Results 

Through this analysis we can see that urban city types carry the highest fare over suburban and rural fare averages. This exercise was useful as a means of learning how to visuaize our data.
